# Hard Drive Failure Detection using S.M.A.R.T attributes on Backblaze dataset.

###Introduction
Hard drives are the most commonly used and failed components in data centers. The data centers use different varieties of hard drives, like HDD and SSD, with various brands, models, and capacities. The HDD drives are the cheapest available on the market, at approximately $40 per TB have high power consumption, slower read/write speeds, and make noise as it has moving parts, whereas the SSD drives are the most expensive, at around $250 per TB have low power consumption, fast read/write speeds, and are completely noiseless.
